bgs might have different names when called in script vs actual filenames.
const dict mappings should be in separate file.


for choices:
m1 maps to en_A1a
m2 maps to en_A1b

both leads to en_A1c


implement effects stuff like show snow, scene black/white
effects like adeout etc.

add fade delay to sprite changes  

implement videos

implement saves
implement choices

figure out how choices jump


less important

colors for names

improve backwards (bg change, sprite change, use a stack)

improve script parser
implement custom positions for sprites
sprite scaling has issues (big sprites are not aligned to bottom)

below should clear sprite..

836 'scene bg tearoom_lillyhisao_noon'
main.js:25 tearoom_lillyhisao_noon
main.js:26 "event/Lilly_supercg/tearoom_lillyhisao_noon.jpg"
main.js:216 837 'show tearoom_hisao smile'
main.js:216 838 'show tearoom_lilly smileclosed'
main.js:216 839 'with fade'
main.js:216 840 `"As she sets down the tea, I gently take it and have a sip. I'm really more of a coffee person, but this seems like a rather bad moment to bring it up."`

might need to hardcode all the routes.

{A1: {…}, A3: {…}, A6: {…}, A8: {…}}
A1: {a: false, b: true}
A3: {a: true, b: false, c: false}
A6: {a: false, b: true}
A8: {a: false, b: true}
