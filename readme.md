# KS Web Port

Because this is an easy (enough) visual novel to reverse and reimplement.

## Known Bugs
- Skipping text too quickly will cause sprites to disappear/appear before they are supposed to or at wrong places. Mostly because of the jQuery fade function having race conditions.
- The log is not working as it should. Might need to implement using a stack data structure.
- There are probably lots of visual bugs not yet fixed.

## Not yet implemented
- Animations, effects, video, etc.
- Affection points system
- Multiple save slots
- All routes
